## Assignment Tasks

### Problem 1: Integer Solutions to √a + √b = √2025
Find all integer pairs (a, b) ≥ 0 such that the sum of their square roots equals the square root of 2025.

### Problem 2: Pyramid Volume from Sheet Metal
Determine the volume of a square-based pyramid created by folding a cut sheet and tabulate results using PrettyTable.

### Problem 3: Mass Grid - Centroid and Principal Axes
Given a grid of point masses, calculate the centroid, moments of inertia, and plot the principal axes.

### Problem 4: T-Beam Cross-Section Geometry
Using coordinate geometry, calculate the perimeter and area of a T-beam, then plot the section and label vertices.

### Problem 5: Plotting a Function with Discontinuities
Evaluate and plot a discontinuous function with attention to singularities and undefined behavior.
